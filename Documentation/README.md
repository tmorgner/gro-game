# Gro-Game

## Concept

A gardening game where the player has to grow and take care of plants that 
they have to grow fruits and vegetables for sale. The player receives a 
patch of soil to plant seeds and needs to water and fertilize the plans 
for optimal growth. The life and health of the plant is threatened by
various hazards the player has to overcome or defend against.

## Game interface

The game will be a simple 2D click game.

The Game will show the land and plants in a side view. Bar charts indicate
plant health, light and water levels and available nutients for each plant.
By clicking the approproate buttons, the player can intiate various actions:

* Water the plant
* Feed the plant
* Defend the plant: Squash Bugs / scare away birds etc / pull out weeds

Within the environment plants also need sun light and space to grow. 
Planting seeds to close to each other will result in stunted growth. 
(There is nothing the player can do to fix that other than killing 
competing plants quickly.)

## Mechanics

Plant health depends on the availability of 3 factors: Sun light, Water
and Nutrition. Plants need an optimum level of these elements to grow
strong and produce the best fruits. Giving either too much or too little
of the required resources results in stunted grows or even death of the 
plant.

### Plant Life

1. Seed Stage

   All plants start as seeds that are planted by the player somewhere on the
   plot of land. After watering, the seed will germinate and the seed will
   turn into a young plant.

   This stage will be about set up which includes picking the different types 
   of soil and what seeds that they want to grow. The player will then be 
   planting the seed that they want to grow. After planting the seed 
   the player has to water them by a small amount to start the germination
   process. (This teaches the player to apply water and (via similar mechanic:
   fertilizer (which is first applied in stage 2))

   At this stage adding too much water cannot do harm so this is a safe
   playground for the player to get used to the controls. 

   Just before the second stage starts, a crow flies in to snatch the seed.
   The player will have to chase the beast away, and thus learns how to deal
   with pests.

   Resources: Seeds only need sufficient water to germinate.

   Hazards: Birds love to eat seeds

2. Young Plant

   Once the seed has developed shoots and roots to break through the
   soil surface the plant starts to consume nutrition from the soil 
   and uses sun light to grow. 

   Resources: Water, Nutrition, Sun

   Water and nutrition must be given regularly. Too much water and the
   roots start to rot away. Too little water and the leaves dry out.
   Too much sun without sufficient water can even kill the plant.
   Too much nutrition may attract weeds and or mould/mushrooms. 
   
   Hazards: Bugs love their prey young! Worms may start attacking the
   seedling's new roots. 

   *Possible Extension point*: Spiders appear that help eat some bugs.
   Not all insects are bad, after all. 

3. Mature Plant: Flowering

   Plants develop flowers to attract pollinating insects. The player
   now has to discriminate between good and bad insects and needs to
   protect the blossom until it has been successfully pollinated by
   bees or butterflies.

   If the blossom has not been pollinated by the end of this stage
   the plant will not develop fruits.

   Note: Garden plants usually have more than one blossom to safeguard
   against failure. We could reward the player based on how many 
   pods have been pollinated instead of killing the fun with a binary
   decision. 

   Resources: Water, Nutrition, Sun

   Hazards: Bugs may eat leaves and flower pods. Only well developed
   flowers have a high chance of attracting bees. Ugly kids die alone!

4. Ripening Phase

   After pollination blossom pods turn into fruits. The plants need
   sufficient light, water and nutrition now. The more the fruit 
   ripens the more attractive it becomes for bugs, so you should see
   more nasty crawlers as the stage progresses.

5. Harvest time / Scoring.

   When the plant is fully grown the fruit can be harvested. The player
   can either sell the fruit for points or turn it into more seeds.
   The dead plant turns into fertilizer that kick starts the next
   round.

   If the score is good they will be corwned King/Queen of Plants.
   (That should avoid the need for high score lists.)

## Stretch Goal: Different Soil type 

Soil defines how quickly water evaporates, how likely roots rot away
and how much nutrition can be stored in the soil. 

Rich, fertile soil holds good amounts of water and nutrition, while
stony soil is low on nutrition and water. Different plants grow better
in certain soil types.

## Plant types

Potatoes
  - insensitive to soil type
  - medium height during blooming phase
  - https://gardenerspath.com/uncategorized/gimme-those-potatoes-a-spud-growing-guide/

Peppers:
  - medium height plants, needs support
  - blocks light on ground!
  - https://gardenerspath.com/plants/vegetables/growing-using-bell-peppers/

Strawberries
  - low on ground
  - sensitive to water logging
  - https://gardenerspath.com/plants/fruit/grow-strawberries/

Each plant has different needs of water, nutrition and light.
The player has to learn to optimize their garden by planting 
a good combination of plants.

## Hazards

### Birds

Bad: Eat seeds, pick on fruits (causes maggots, lowers quality)
Good: Eat bugs

### Worms

Bad: Attack roots.
Good: Distribute nutrition, improve soil quality

### Caterpilar & Bugs

Bad: Eat leaves
Good: Is there ever anything good about caterpilars? 

### Bees

Bad: No bee ever did something objectible.
Good: Pollinate flowers
